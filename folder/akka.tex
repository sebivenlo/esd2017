The Actor model enables users to distribute their threads between
multiple machines, even networks. By composing small, independent sub
tasks, the real location of processing does not matter anymore. Image
a network which can run programs wherever some free capacity
exists. This not only will increase your programâ€™s speed but also
increases the utilization of all nodes involved. 
Attend the AKKA workshop and redefine your understanding of
concurrency!
