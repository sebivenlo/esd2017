The workshop is about JHipster featuring Angular 4 and Springboot. It
allows the user to generate a complete and modern web app or
microservice architecture. Angular 4 is a platform for modern
front-end web application development. Spring Boot provides an easy
way to let Angular communicate with the back-end java application. An
introduction in JHipster is given by providing a live demonstration of
how to generate an application. Users get to experience generating an
application with JHipster themselves. Lastly we will provide hands-on
assignments to get familiar with JHipster.
