We want to inform students about MQTT, what is MQTT but most
important, where MQTT can be used for. 

This, we want to present by setting up a broker-client model in which
a chatroom can be implemented. 

Facebook messenger is one of the many applications of this protocol. Messenger is a daily used and an easy to understand application. 
By implementing this way, we want to give a high level overview of
what MQTT is about.
